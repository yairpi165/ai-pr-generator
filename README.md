# 🧠 AI Pull Request Generator (Terminal Edition)

This tool generates high-quality, well-structured pull request (PR) descriptions by analyzing your current Git diff and calling **Gemini AI**.

It supports specifying the PR type, custom title, and optional ticket name — all from the terminal.  
The output is saved to `pr-description.md` and opened automatically in your editor.

---

## ✨ Features

- PR types: `feature`, `bugfix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, `other`
- Optional title prompt or auto-generated by AI
- Optional ticket integration (e.g. `RND-1234`)
- AI-generated description in **Markdown** format
- Simple usage with `./generate.sh` or a custom alias
- Works with `cursor`, `code`, or your preferred editor

# RND-4567: Improve login UX

## 🧠 Summary
This PR improves the user login experience by validating inputs and displaying inline error messages.

## ✅ Changes
- Added email and password validation
- Refactored error handling in the login form
- Updated styling for inline error messages

## 🔍 Context

## ⚡️ Optional: Add Terminal Alias

So you can run `genpr` from anywhere:

1. Open your shell config file:

```bash
nano ~/.zshrc
```

2. Add:

```bash
alias genpr="~/generate-pr-desc/generate.sh"
```

3. Reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now you can simply run:

```bash
genpr bugfix "Fix crash on iOS"
```
