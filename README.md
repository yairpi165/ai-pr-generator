# 🧠 AI Pull Request Generator (Terminal Edition)

Generate beautiful, structured pull request descriptions using **Gemini AI**, straight from your terminal.

This tool analyzes your Git diff, prompts for the PR type, title, and optional ticket ID, and generates a complete, professional-looking PR description saved to `pr-description.md`.

---

## ✨ Features

- Detects current Git diff automatically
- Choose PR type (feature, bugfix, refactor, etc.)
- Optional title prompt or auto-generated by AI
- Optional ticket ID (e.g. `RND-1234`)
- AI-generated description in **Markdown** format
- Preview output and copy to clipboard
- One-liner CLI usage with `genpr` from anywhere

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-pr-generator.git
cd ai-pr-generator
```

### 2. Run the installer

```bash
./install.sh
```

This will:

- Create a Python virtual environment
- Install required dependencies
- Prompt for your Gemini API key
- Add a global terminal alias `genpr` to your shell config

---

## 🔐 Gemini API Key Setup

During installation, the script will ask for your Gemini API key and automatically create a `.env` file for you.

If you'd like to set it manually:

1. Visit: [https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click **“Create API Key”**
4. Paste your key into a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

---

## 🧪 Usage Examples

### Interactive

```bash
genpr
```

You'll be asked for:
- PR type (feature, bugfix, etc.)
- PR title (optional)
- Ticket ID (optional)

### One-liner

```bash
genpr feature "Add search bar to homepage"
```

You can also skip the title and let the AI generate one.
